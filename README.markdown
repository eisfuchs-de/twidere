##Twidere - Twitter client, ∞##

NOTE: This is not the original Twidere client! This is an adaptation by Dario Abatianni <eisfuchs@tigress.com> to include an alternative timeline design. You can find the original Twidere client at GitHub (source code): https://github.com/mariotaku/twidere

Twidere is a powerful twitter client for Android 1.6+, which gives you a full Holo theme and much more.
